    <string name="app_desc">Do you like swimming and sunbathing? We too!
    Because of that we have decided to create this app! In Carintia you have plenty of possibilities to go for swimming!
    The blue water of lakes, breathtaking outlooks, sunshine and a lot of positive emotions
    are waiting for you on the beach! I love it so much, that I often start to swim in May!
    But sometimes it is really cold in this time and so it would be great to have a look at
    water temperatures! Searching for it in the Internet is not really comfortable. So it\'s great to have an app for it.
    Do you feel it sometimes that you are bored to go to Strandbad every time?
    If yes, then it\'s not a problem, because with a help of our app you can find
    all the places, that are close to you and also check water temperature for them!
    So, enjoy our app and we are happy, if you like it!</string>
